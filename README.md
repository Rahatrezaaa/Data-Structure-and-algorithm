Exercises and mini projects in python implementing knowledge of DSA.
These are exercises of the course I am taking online from Udacity Nanodegree Program

Project1: Python refreshers, including object oriented programming and built-in Data structure of Python
 
In this project,I did five tasks based on a fabricated set of calls and texts exchanged during September 2016.I used Python to analyze and answer questions about the texts and calls contained in the dataset. Lastly,performed run time analysis of the solution and determined its efficiency.
